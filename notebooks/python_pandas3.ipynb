Today we will use data from the [Open Power Systems Data site](https://data.open-power-system-data.org/renewable_power_plants/), which has multiple CSV files for different countries showing their renewable energy power power plants and subsequent capacity.  If you hover over the links for each country, you will see that there is a URL associated with each CSV file.  Instead of downloading the CSV file from the website and then uploading it into Python, we can directly import the data into a Pandas data frame using the URL:"
