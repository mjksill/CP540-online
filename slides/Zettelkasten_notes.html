The purpose of this lecture is to get you thinking about how you
can deal with all the information you
</p>

<p>
The individual facts, concepts, or ideas may not be particularly
interesting on their own, but sometimes the more important things
are the connections between them.
</p>




<p>
My aim is not to tell you how you should do things.  To be honest, I
still am not completely happy with how I keep my own notes.  All I can
do is to offer my experience and talk about things I have done that
have improved
</p>

<p>
Instead, it is to make you aware of the different ways in which people
have thought about taking notes and making them useful.
</p>


<p>
My hope that it will get you started on a way to start building your
knowledge/idea database that you can create and benefit from and
continue to grow

<p>
So let's discuss some initial thoughts about the usefulness (or not)
of taking notes.  This will help us figure out how we might design our
own system for taking notes or working with notes to be most
effective.

Reflect on your progress through the UG degree.  You have progressed

<p>
One of the big ideas that I want to emphasize in this lecture is that
the connections between "information", rather than the information
itself, that is important.
</p>

<p>
The difficulty with University is that the world is changing very
rapidly, and people are only able to cope with
a finite rate of change.
</p>

<p>
In the past, the way we performed research was very different that
how it is done now.
</p>
<ul>
<li>example</li>

</ul>


<p>
How we deal with things has changed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>organizing a meet in the pub</li>
<li>parents planning to cash a check in the grocery store in order to
have enough money to last the week for expenses
<ul>
<li>cash machines means that you don't need to think about having
enough money</li>

<p>
Another typical assumption that we make about information is that it
is mainly associated with nouns and adjectives.  It is something that
refers to some description of something, either through its properties
or its relation to other things.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that you might think of as information is how to
do things or more specifically, code to do things.

<p>
Just think of all the times that you have seen something interesting,
like either a potentially useful piece of data or a nice explanation
of a complicated concept, or a nice tutorial.  You perhaps leave the
tab on your browser open or you might write down a note on a piece of
paper (or even in a notebook)
</p>

<ul>
<li>A big problem is that while you are working on something, such as
a report or on some calculation, you might recall that you had come across
some that would be useful interesting
fact or piece of information</li>

</ul>


<p>
A lot of times you will find yourself writing a fact in a report and
then trying to remember where you got that information in order to
provide a reference.  This might be a correlation to some data that
you tossed into a draft of a report, but you forgot to add a reference
to the source.  Now that you have looked at the equation more
carefully, you realize that what you have written is incomplete, and
that there are parameters in the equation that you forgot to include.
However, now you can remember where you saw the equation.
