The purpose of this lecture is to get you thinking about how you
can deal with all the information you

<p>
My aim is not to tell you how you should do things.  To be honest, I
still am not completely happy with how I keep my own notes.  All I can
do is to offer my experience and talk about things I have done that
have improved
</p>

<p>
Instead, it is to make you aware of the different ways in which people
have thought about taking notes and making them useful.

<p>
My hope that it will get you started on a way to start building your
knowledge/idea database that you can create and benefit from and
continue to grow

<p>
So let's discuss some initial thoughts about the usefulness (or not)
of taking notes.  This will help us figure out how we might design our
own system for taking notes or working with notes to be most
effective.
</p>

<p>
Reflect on your progress through the UG degree.  You have progressed
through the 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Reasons for taking notes</li>
<li>Why organize information?</li>
<li>Issues with just writing things down</li>

</ul>


<p>
Reasons for taking notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>stimulates critical thinking</li>
<li>record of information</li>
<li>helps practice writing</li>
<li>helps understanding</li>
<li>helps memory</li>
<li>helps exam revision</li>

</ul>


<p>
The individual facts, concepts, or ideas may not be particularly
interesting on their own, but sometimes the more important things
are the connections between them.
</p>


<p>
One of the big ideas that I want to emphasize in this lecture is that
the connections between "information", rather than the information
itself, that is important.
</p>

<p>
The difficulty with University is that the world is changing very
rapidly, and people are only able to cope with
a finite rate of change.
</p>

<p>
In the past, the way we performed research was very different that
how it is done now.
</p>
<ul>
<li>example</li>

</ul>


<p>
How we deal with things has changed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>organizing a meet in the pub</li>
<li>parents planning to cash a check in the grocery store in order to
have enough money to last the week for expenses
<ul>
<li>cash machines means that you don't need to think about having
enough money</li>

<blockquote>
Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.
</blockquote>
<br>


<aside class="notes">
<p>
So why should you take notes?
</p>

<p>
One obvious reason is to record information, and this can be thoughts,
ideas, methods of doing things, etc.
</p>

<p>
Just think of all the times that you have seen something interesting,
like either a potentially useful piece of data or a nice explanation
of a complicated concept, or an interesting YouTube video.  You
perhaps leave the tab on your browser open or you might write down a
note on a piece of paper (or even in a notebook)
</p>

<p>
A big problem is that while you are working on something, such as a
report or on some calculation, you might recall that you had come
across some that would be useful interesting fact or piece of
information
</p>

<p>
A lot of times you will find yourself writing a fact in a report and
then trying to remember where you got that information in order to
provide a reference.  This might be a correlation to some data that
you tossed into a draft of a report, but you forgot to add a reference
to the source.  Now that you have looked at the equation more
carefully, you realize that what you have written is incomplete, and
that there are parameters in the equation that you forgot to include.
However, now you can remember where you saw the equation.
</p>

<p>
By taking notes, we externally record and store ideas so that we can,
in principle, use or think about them in detail, later.
This let's you focus on what you are doing.
</p>



<p>
It is important that you record interesting thoughts as completely as
possible.  Make sure that you never let anything get in the way of you
writing down (or recording in a different way) an idea.  You want to
have as low a barrier as possible to recording your thoughts.  So,
whether this is audio recordings on your phone, scribbles on a
notepad, or an open Word document on your computer, make sure you have
some mechanism for recording information.
</p>

<p>
As part of this, you need some effective method to translate these raw
records into some uniform format that you can

<p>
So, hopefully I have convinced you that one of the reasons you should
take notes is to record information.  Now, let's try to consider what
is information.
</p>

<p>
What do we mean by information?  Most of us in school have been taught that
there are two types of "information", which are typically referred to as
facts or opinion.  By fact, we mean something that is
</p>

<p>
Another typical assumption that we make about information is that it
is mainly associated with nouns and adjectives.  It is something that
refers to some description of something, either through its properties
or its relation to other things.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that you might think of as information is how to
do things or more specifically, code to do things.

<ul>
<li>Atomic</li>
<li>Autonomous</li>
<li>Connected</li>

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
There are three big ideas that the Zettelkasten method pushes for
taking effective "permanent" notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>atomic</li>
<li>autonomous</li>
<li>connectivity</li>

</ul>


<ul>
<li><p>
Atomic
</p>

<p>
One of the key principles of the Zettelkasten method is that you want
to capture ideas on single note cards and that these note cards should
each only contain a single idea.
</p>

<p>
What are the issues with taking "atomic" notes?
</p>

<p>
When I start trying to write down an idea, there ends up being a lot
of concepts, information, etc. in the notes that I generate.  For
example, perhaps I am thinking about continuing work on developing an
approximate free energy functional that satisfies self-consistency
relations and is applicable to describing aggregate formation.  The
mathematical derivation may not nicely split up into small, individual
units.  They are necessarily connected.
</p>

<p>
Why do we only want one idea per note?  What is the problem with
just keeping this large note that contains a bunch of ideas?  I find
that in writing later notes, when I return to an idea on a related
topic, I end up repeating what I had said before to a large degree.
Also, there is less of a tendency to go back and read my previous
notes.  I end up just "collecting" the ideas rather than trying to
think about them to move my thoughts forward.
</p>

<p>
We can try to fix this issue by leaving the original note in place,
perhaps in a daily note, and then postpone the process of splitting
the note into "atomic" notes during a later review process.  The fear
is that we may not be able to find these atomic notes later, but
perhaps we can hedge against this by using tags related to the
categories that it may be relevant to.  Also, we might link the atomic
note to the daily note or the original source note.
</p></li>

<li><p>
autonomous
</p>

<p>
The notes should be understandable on their own.  It should not
require additional context for a reader to understand its meaning.
It might refer to external information, but it should not depend on
this external information.
</p>

<p>
Why is this?  While a note you write may make sense to you when you
write it, and even a few days later, after a year or so, this may
not be easy to understand.
</p></li>

<li>connectivity
<ul>
<li>uplinks</li>
<li>backlinks</li>
<li></li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<p>
One of the main pr
</p>




<p>
With this, we need to emphasize the importance of using good tags to
find your information later.  You might thing of tags as being the
categories that you would have used to file your note away in a
conventional hierarchical organization system.

I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to
technologies:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and
ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</li>
<li>Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and
thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can
probably get a career in it.</li>
<li>Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural
order of things.</li>

As mentioned previously, the environment that we find ourselves in is
changing rapidly.  A lot of the tools that we have access to now did not
exist just a few years ago.  
Consequently, one of the main things that we need to consider is
future proofing our work.

<p>
In my undergraduate, my first laboratory report was written on a
typewriter.  It was not until my second or third year that PC's and
wordprocessing programs became prevalent.
</p>

<p>
By the time I started my PhD, the standard for word processing was
WordPerfect, and my first reports were written using this.
