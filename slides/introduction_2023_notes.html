<p>
Hello, my name is Dr Leo Lue, and welcome to CP540: Project planning,
management and methods.  You might remember me from the tutorial
sessions for CP213.  
</p>

<p>
The key purpose of this module is to provide you the tools to help
your conduct a substantial technical project, such as the project that
you will undertake in semester 2.
</p>

<p>
and demonstrate various transferable skills (e.g., note taking,
writing, visualization of data, etc.) 
</p>


<p>
The environment in which we are working in, and in which we will be
working in the near future, is rapidly changing.  This is partly
because technology is changing quite rapidly, and the way that we work
as an engineer today is not the same as what we did ten or twenty
years ago.  Because things are rapidly developing and changing so
quickly, standards and expectations have not had a chance to develop.
Part of what we will be doing is introducing some of these new tools
to you.  
</p>

<p>
and provide some examples of software tools that can help you apply
and exercise those skills.  It is not meant to dictate the methods and
tools that you should use, but rather it is to show you what is
available and what you can do with them, their strengths and
weaknesses, etc.
</p>

<p>
So, I am just going to show you what is out there.  It may be that in
a couple years, what I show you may be obsolete, but this is the
environment that we are working in.  However, I will try to offer you
strategies to try to "future proof" yourselves and mitigate against
this.
</p>

<p>
This lecture will give an overview of the module aims and contents.
Its aim is to provide you an overview of

I am the coordinator for this module and will also be the main
lecturer.  The demonstrators for the module will be Thomas Paterson
and Angharad Wood, both of whom were UG students on the MEng chemical
engineering course here and are also both currently PhD students in
the department.
</p>

<p>
In addition, visiting professors Scott Allen, from Allen and
Associates, and Katie Murray, from AstraZeneca, will be providing
workshops on project planning and monitoring.

<p>
Alasdair Stewart from the library will be giving lectures on
searching the scientific literature and reference management.

The main learning objectives are to provide you with a set of
transferable skills that you can use not only to specifically prepare
and deliver your research or industrial placement project next
semester, but hopefully be useful in your career after university
as well as your general life.

There are three components of assessment for this module: a project
plan for your activities in this academic year, which is worth 20% of
the module marks, an exercise on the processing, analysis, and visual
presentation of data, which is worth 30% of the module marks, and a
literature review on a topic based on sustainable development.
