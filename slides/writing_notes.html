Writing is a crucial activity that we, as engineers, typically do not
give enough attention.
</p>

<p>
In this lecture, we will cover some general aspects of writing, which
might change your perspective on the importance of writing
and what it can do for you.

</p>

<p>
Typically, we think of writing as a means of communication.  This is
one of its main uses.  We tend to think of this mainly in terms of
conveying information or ideas to other people.
</p>

<p>
However, we can generalize this slightly to communicating with our
future selves.  In thinking of things in this way, we can see another
function of writing as a means of recording or remembering thoughts or
information.
</p>

<p>
However, it serves a few other important roles.  One important function
is to remember

</p>

<p>
A very crucial function of writing is thinking.
</p>

<p>
As I had mentioned previously, one idea for the evolution of language
is not for communication but mainly for thinking.  Some researchers
think that communication was only a by-product.
</p>

<p>
Many species of animals can communicate, but one of the things that
distinguishes humans from other animals.
</p>

<p>
Thinking is writing!
Writing is thinking.

</ul>

<p>
This is what much of what your writing had been about.  It is a very
crucial part of thinking.  This is why I encourage you to take notes,
but is mainly why I think it is extremely important for you to reflect
on your notes and try to make connections between them that are
documented in writing.
</p>

<p>
Writing is essential to thinking of you are trying to process
complicated ideas.  This does not have to be in the form of text, but
it can be in the form of diagrams, drawings, mathematical expressions,
etc.
</p>



<p>
This is also why writing is so hard.
</p>


<p>
Have you ever met someone think that they knew how to sing, or perhaps
you think that you know some song.  Then someone asks you how the song
goes, but you can hum it well enough or at least to a recognizable level
to where the other person can identify the song.
</p>

<p>
You use your writing to help you think.

to think up new ideas about the world&#x2026;  This is not what a journalist does

<p>
You have been taught in school and in university that writing
is mainly to convey your thoughts to the reader.
</p>

<p>
Now think back to the writing that you did in school.  What was the
purpose of that writing?  How or why did you get a good Mark on this
past writing assignments?
</p>

<p>
Their main purpose, for you, was to demonstrate what you understood.
As a consequence you have learned to write in an environment in which
your readers were made to care about you.  Essentially, you paid for
someone to read your writing.  Instead, you want to get people to pay
to read your writing.
</p>

<p>
Most of your writing in school and university has been to convey your
thoughts to the reader.  This work was mainly written for a captive
audience who was paid to read your writing.  It was the reader's job
to go through your work to get an idea of the level of your
understanding.  There was no need to gain and keep the interest of the
reader.
</p>

<p>
no need to make the writing in any way useful or valuable to the reader.

What happens to readers when they encounter a piece of writing that is
not written in a way that they read?

<aside class="notes">
<p>
One of the things that you should try to get out of your mind is that
a piece of work has an objective, intrinsic value.  This is true for
both theoretical and experimental work.  It doesn't necessarily matter
that
</p>


<p>
For example, my father was a chemist who worked for Motorola, and one
of his tasks was to create a plastic to be used as packaging for
semiconductor wafers that would be able to keep oxygen from coming
into contact with it, thereby damaging it.  However, no matter what he
did, the materials that he created just kept on letting oxygen pass
freely through it.
</p>

<p>
However, this material was perfect for contact lenses, where you need
to let oxygen pass through the lens so that the eye can "breathe".  So
from the perspective of packaging for a semiconductor, this material
was useless; however, from the perspective of a soft contact lens,
this material was extremely valuable.  Objectively, there is no
intrinsic value to the material.  It was all dependent on its context.
</p>

In Western academia, nothing will be accepted as knowledge until
someone that is competent has challenged it.

With the reader!!!
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So hopefully I have convinced you that the most important aspect of
professional writing is to make it valuable to the reader.  Now we
need to figure out how to do this.  Before we can start, we need to
think about what gives value to a reader.
</p>


<p>
Where does value lie?  Many people think that value lies objectively
in the world.  What makes a piece of writing valuable?  What makes a
piece of work valuable?
</p>

<p>
There is no such thing as an objectively valuable piece of work, and
as a corollary, there is no such thing as an objectively valuable
piece of writing.  The best that we can hope for is that something is
collectively subjectively valuable.
</p>

<p>
Value lies in the reader.
</p>

<p>
The same piece of writing can be extremely valuable and useful to one
reader and be completely meaningless and a waste of time for another.
You should not try to write for the generic reader.  That reader does not
exist.
</p>

<p>
You need to think about difference between readers.

<p>
One common piece of advice that teachers often give to students about
writing, is that you should target your work to be comprehensible by
sixth grade students.  That is, you should be writing in a style that
is understandable and of interest to a broad, general audience.
</p>

<p>
This is not necessarily useful.  Your writing should be targeted to a
specific audience.

The main purpose of technical writing is to inform, rather than to

is changing their ideas.

First, I am going to break the rule and tell you a bunch of textual
form based rules; however, you should just consider these as
guidelines.  This is just a formulaic way to put together a decent
report or technical document.  So, it can be bland.  The main thing is
the make the reader's job as simple as possible.
</p>

<p>
If you can add value to the reader by breaking any of these rules,
then you should definitely do so.  Again, the emphasis should be on
function over form.
