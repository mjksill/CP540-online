<p>
Hello, my name is Leo Lue, and welcome to CP540: Project planning,
management and methods.  You might remember me from CP213.
</p>

<p>
The key purpose of this module is to provide you with tools to help
your conduct a substantial technical project, such as the project that
you will undertake for 18530.
</p>

<p>
and demonstrate various transferable skills (e.g., note taking,
writing, visualization of data, etc.) 
</p>

<p>
The environment in which we are working in, and in which we will be
working in the near future, is rapidly changing.  This is partly
because technology is changing quite rapidly, and the way that we work
as an engineer today is not the same as what we did ten or twenty
years ago.  Because things are rapidly developing and changing so
quickly, standards and expectations have not had a chance to develop.
Part of what we will be doing is introducing some of these new tools
to you.  
</p>

<p>
and provide some examples of software tools that can help you apply
and exercise those skills.  It is not meant to dictate the methods and
tools that you should use, but rather it is to show you what is
available and what you can do with them, their strengths and
weaknesses, etc.
</p>

<p>
So, I am just going to show you what is out there.  It may be that in
a couple years, what I show you may be obsolete, but this is the
environment that we are working in.  However, I will try to offer you
strategies to try to "future proof" yourselves and mitigate against
this.
</p>

<p>
This lecture will give an overview of the module aims and contents.
Its aim is to provide you an overview of

Welcome, I am the coordinator for this module and will also be the
main lecturer.  The demonstrators for the module will be Thomas
Paterson and Zoe Macpherson.
</p>

<p>
both of whom were UG students on the MEng
chemical engineering course here and are also both currently PhD
students in the department.
</p>

<p>
In addition, Dr Kenneth Moffat, who is the director of the distance
learning programme within the department, will be providing a lecture
on project planning and monitoring.
</p>

<p>
Alasdair Stewart from the library will be giving lectures on
searching the scientific literature and reference management.
</p>

<p>
The lecture/workshop sessions will take place in GH634 on Thursdays
from 09.00 to 11.00.
</p>


<p>
In addition, visiting professors Scott Allen, from Allen and
Associates, and Katie Murray, from AstraZeneca, will be providing
workshops on project planning and monitoring.

communication

<p>
The tools that we have change the way we thing about solutions.  They
change the way that we think about the world and interact with it and
other people around us.
</p>

<p>
Transition from the pre-modern to the modern period has changed the way
that we value things.
</p>

<p>
The demographic transition, which you may remember from CP305: Ethics,
Sustainability, and Economics, is a consequence of the shift of viewing
children as a resource to an expense.
</p>

<p>
This is a tool that has already made a significant impact on education
and is starting to change the way we view and value content.

<p>
will change
</p>

<p>
So where will value lie
</p>

<p>
How can we add value?

The main learning objectives are to provide you with a set of
transferable skills that you can use not only to specifically prepare
and deliver your research or industrial placement project next
semester, but hopefully be useful in your career after university
as well as your general life.

There are three components of assessment for this module: a project
plan for your activities in this academic year, which is worth 20% of
the module marks, an exercise on the processing, analysis, and visual
presentation of data, which is worth 30% of the module marks, and a
literature review on a topic based on sustainable development.

In week 2, there will be a lecture and workshop delivered by Dr
Kenneth Moffat, who is the director of distance learning programmes
within the department.
</p>

<p>
Based on this, you will develop a project plan for delivering all
elements of the UG course, which includes activities necessary for
</p>
<ul>
<li>submission of coursework,</li>
<li>preparation for tests and exams</li>
<li>securing placement, which may include

<li>executing 18530 project</li>
<li>final submission of 18530 report</li>

You might want to include other aspects of your life that are not
directly related, such as searching for a job after graduation.

<p>
During the course of the semester

<p>
Finally, at the end of the semester in week 11, Katie Murray
give a workshop on project

<p>
The assessment will be based on the quality of the initial project
plan.

<p>
The reason for this is that this will give you the opportunity to
see if
