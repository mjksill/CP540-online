<p>
The purpose of this lecture is to get you thinking about how you can
deal with all the information you will encounter.  This will be mainly
focused on things that are relevant to the course, but hopefully it
will also be useful in other areas and activities in your life.
</p>

<p>
On the course, you have had to deal with
which not only includes
material from lectures, textbooks, journal articles that you will

<p>
You probably already have a system that you

<p>
Each of you definitely already have a way of taking notes and
organizing tasks that you need to get done.  My purpose is not to try
to change the way your are doing things or to tell you there are
better ways of organizing yourself.  In this lecture, I just want to
show you some ideas that people have put forward, and for you to make
a decision as to whether they are worthwhile for you.  This will be a
personal choice, and there is no one "right answer".  As for myself,
the way I take notes
</p>


<p>
In this lecture, we will be going over some ideas and methods for
taking notes.
</p>

<p>
All of you have already been doing this for quite a while.  
</p>

<p>
My aim is not to tell you the right or wrong way to do things or even
dictate to you how you should do things.  To be honest, I still am not
completely happy with how I keep my own notes.  All I can do is to
offer my experience and talk about things I have done that have
improved the way I work.  This lecture is meant to be helpful to you
in improving your own way of taking notes.
</p>

<p>
We live now in an environment where there is a glut of information.
This environment has changed since you started school.  In some
senses, because of this, we will not need to take notes, but for other
reasons, it may be more important than ever for us to take notes.
</p>

<p>
Instead, it is to make you aware of the different ways in which people
have thought about taking notes and making them useful.  We will be
looking at strategies for taking notes and organizing information.
</p>

<p>
Another reason that I am giving this lecture is that a large part of
the final assessment are the notes that you take for the essay.  I am
not just interested in the quality of the literature review that you
will produce, but I am also interested in the way that you went about
constructing the final product.
</p>

<p>
How are you taking notes and how effective is is?  What does and
doesn't work?  Now that there are "new" tools available, can these
help you?
</p>

<p>
My hope that it will get you started on a way to start building your
knowledge/idea database that you can create and benefit from and
continue to grow.  Also, I hope this will be a skill that will

<p>
First we will cover some motivations of why you want to take notes,
this will inform the system that we might develop to collect,
organize, and use our notes.
</p>

<p>
Then we will discuss some of the challenges that we might face in not
only creating the notes but also effective using them.
</p>

<p>
Based on this, we will then try to sketch out what features a good note
taking system might have.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Before we can really talk about improving the way we take notes, we
need to understand why we might want to take notes and what we want
the system we develop to help us with.
</p>

<p>
So let's discuss some initial thoughts about the usefulness (or not)
of taking notes.  This will help us figure out how we might design our
own system for taking notes or working with notes to be most
effective.
</p>

<p>
Reflect on your progress through school and the UG degree.  When did
you start taking notes?  Why did you do this?  Were you told to do so,
or was it something you did by yourself?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Reasons for taking notes</li>
<li>Why organize information?</li>
<li>Issues with just writing things down</li>

</ul>


<p>
practice writing, articulating thoughts
writing is for thinking
</p>

<p>
Reasons for taking notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>stimulates critical thinking</li>
<li>record of information</li>
<li>helps practice writing</li>
<li>helps understanding</li>
<li>helps memory</li>
<li>helps exam revision</li>

</ul>

<p>
Besides school, do you take notes in other parts of your life?  Did
you have to take notes in any jobs that you had?
</p>


<p>
The individual facts, concepts, or ideas may not be particularly
interesting on their own, but sometimes the more important things
are the connections between them.
</p>

<p>
One of the big ideas that I want to emphasize in this lecture is that
the connections between "information", rather than the information
itself, that is important.
</p>

<p>
As we will be discussing later, the manner in which we frame issues
deeply affects how we think of them.  This is partly a consequence of how
we connect different ideas.
</p>

<p>
The difficulty with University is that the world is changing very
rapidly, and people are only able to cope with a finite rate of
change.
</p>

<p>
In the past, the way we performed research was very different that
how it is done now.  For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>molecular simulation</li>
<li>experiments
<ul>
<li></li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<p>
How we deal with things has changed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>organizing a meet in the pub</li>
<li>parents planning to cash a check in the grocery store in order to
have enough money to last the week for expenses
<ul>
<li>cash machines means that you don't need to think about having
enough money</li>
<li>organizing gigs</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<p>
This has probably changed what skills are important to develop.  For
example, perhaps developing
</p>

<p>
being able to focus on a problem for
</p>

<p>
the advent of writing reduced the need for memorization.  So now the
skill to develop is to read and write.  The need to remember things is
even less important with the internet and search engines&#x2026;. LLM

<blockquote>
Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.
</blockquote>
<br>


<aside class="notes">
<p>
So why should you take notes?
</p>

<p>
One obvious reason is to record information, and this can be thoughts,
ideas, methods of doing things, etc.
</p>

<p>
Just think of all the times that you have seen something interesting,
like either a potentially useful piece of data or a nice explanation
of a complicated concept, or an interesting YouTube video.  You
perhaps leave the tab on your browser open or you might write down a
note on a piece of paper (or even in a notebook)
</p>

<p>
A big problem is that while you are working on something, such as a
report or on some calculation, you might recall that you had come
across some that would be useful interesting fact or piece of
information.
</p>

<p>
A lot of times you will find yourself writing a fact in a report and
then trying to remember where you got that information in order to
provide a reference.  This might be a correlation to some data that
you tossed into a draft of a report, but you forgot to add a reference
to the source.  Now that you have looked at the equation more
carefully, you realize that what you have written is incomplete, and
that there are parameters in the equation that you forgot to include.
However, now you can remember where you saw the equation.
</p>

<p>
By taking notes, we externally record and store ideas so that we can,
in principle, use or think about them in detail, later.
This let's you focus on what you are doing.
</p>

<p>
It is important that you record interesting thoughts as completely as
possible.  Make sure that you never let anything get in the way of you
writing down (or recording in a different way) an idea.  You want to
have as low a barrier as possible to recording your thoughts.  So,
whether this is audio recordings on your phone, scribbles on a
notepad, or an open Word document on your computer, make sure you have
some mechanism for recording information.
</p>

<p>
As part of this, you need some effective method to translate these raw
records into some uniform format that you can

<ul>
<li>Capture</li>

<li>Organize</li>
<li>Review</li>
<li>Engage</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Getting Things Done (or GTD for short) is a system to organize your
workflow to make you more productive.  
</p>

<p>
The key premise is that if you have a bunch of thoughts bouncing
around your head that you want to remember, then that adds stress, and it makes
it difficult for you to focus.
</p>

<p>
The key idea is to get a list of specific tasks or actions that are prioritized 
</p>

<p>
It consists of five main steps.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Capture:
</p>

<p>
As we discussed before, it is important to write down information so
it is not rattling around in our head, distracting us from focusing
on tasks.  In this step, you find a way to capture information, such
as tasks or data or references, etc. and record it.
</p>

<p>
the capture step should not be censored.  Do not worry about where
to put the material or whether any task is important.  The goal is
to dump and record all the thoughts that are going through your
head, so you don't need to worry about remembering them.
</p></li>

</ul>


<ul>
<li><p>
Process
</p>

<p>
For each piece of information Is it actionable?  That is, is it a
specific task.  If yes, then if it will take less than two minutes
to complete, then you should just complete the task.  If it will
take longer than two minutes, then you should add the task to an
action list, which is a list of tasks that you will do later.
</p>

<p>
If the item is not actionable, then you need to decide to discard
it, or to file the information.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Organize
</p>

<p>
You need to organize and prioritize your action list based on
</p>
<ul>
<li>project</li>
<li>time</li>
<li>context</li>

</ul>

<p>
Actions that are related to each other by the fact that they relate
to the same project, should be grouped together.
</p>

<p>
Actions have a deadline should go on the calendar.
</p>

<p>
Group actions by context, in the sense of time when you can do these
tasks together.  For example, if you are going to be in the library,
perhaps there are several different tasks that you might be able to
sort in the same trip.  Or perhaps there are a group of related
tasks that would be natural for you to work on in the same sitting.
</p>

<p>
What is the next action?
</p>

<p>
non-actionable items
</p>
<ul>
<li>keep for reference</li>
<li>deferred for later
<ul>
<li>some day later
<ul>
<li>create an action item to review at a specific later date.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

<li><p>
Review
</p>

<p>
Every week review your items on your actions list.  In addition you
probably do want to perform a capture list.
</p>

<p>
Every month review your short term goals
</p></li>

<li>Engage</li>

<p>
So, hopefully I have convinced you that one of the reasons you should
take notes is to record information.  Now, let's try to consider what
is information.
</p>

<p>
What do we mean by information?  Most of us in school have been taught that
there are two types of "information", which are typically referred to as
facts or opinion.  By fact, we mean something that is
</p>

<p>
Another typical assumption that we make about information is that it
is mainly associated with nouns and adjectives.  It is something that
refers to some description of something, either through its properties
or its relation to other things.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that you might think of as information is how to
do things or more specifically, code to do things.

<p>
We have been discussing what information is and touching on different
strategies or methods of 
</p>

<ul>
<li>collection of websites, downloaded *.pdf, a browser filled with tabs
that contain YouTube videos that look interesting to watch</li>
<li>the simple awareness of information is conflated with understanding</li>
<li>In the older days, you will see people that are really proud of
their book collection</li>

</ul>


<p>
The Japanese have even created a word for this: Tsundoku
</p>

<p>
buying a book,
</p>


<p>
Just collecting facts might make you more knowledgeable, but it does
not necessarily help you.
</p>

<p>
The real power of knowing facts is to be able to relate it to other
things.  A big collection of facts does not really help you if you
can't relate them to things to each other, let alone to things that
are important to you.
</p>

<p>
In fact, this is related to how you might remember things.  People
that are able to remember large number of facts tend to relate these
to stories or images that they may tell themselves.  If they are able
to connect these facts together, then they are easier to remember.  
</p>

relation to song lyrics&#x2026; some power song lyrics come from metaphors
or suggestions that have some kind of ambiguity that connect several
concepts or emotions in your head.

</p>

<p>
This also touches on why plagiarism is not "good".  There is this idea
of passing thoughts or ideas off as your own, which does raise ethical
issues; however, I don't think that this is the main problem with
plagiarism.
</p>


<p>
When you plagiarize, it is like you are simply collecting the
information and tossing it in a pile of other information.  The
connections, implications, or relations to other parts of the original
work are potentially ripped out of context and placed in an
environment (the text around the plagiarized text) that does not
necessarily have the same relation.  As a consequence, it does not
convey the same meaning.

The PESTEL Analysis: This framework is used to analyze the political,
economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal factors that
can impact a business. It can be used to identify opportunities and
threats, and to develop strategies to mitigate risks.

<h2 id="org8660200">Principles of constructing notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Atomic</li>
<li>Autonomous</li>
<li>Connected</li>

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
There are three big ideas that the Zettelkasten method pushes for
taking effective "permanent" notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>atomic</li>
<li>autonomous</li>
<li>connectivity</li>

</ul>


<ul>
<li><p>
Atomic
</p>

<p>
One of the key principles of the Zettelkasten method is that you want
to capture ideas on single note cards and that these note cards should
each only contain a single idea.
</p>

<p>
What are the issues with taking "atomic" notes?
</p>

<p>
When I start trying to write down an idea, there ends up being a lot
of concepts, information, etc. in the notes that I generate.  For
example, perhaps I am thinking about continuing work on developing an
approximate free energy functional that satisfies self-consistency
relations and is applicable to describing aggregate formation.  The
mathematical derivation may not nicely split up into small, individual
units.  They are necessarily connected.
</p>

<p>
Why do we only want one idea per note?  What is the problem with
just keeping this large note that contains a bunch of ideas?  I find
that in writing later notes, when I return to an idea on a related
topic, I end up repeating what I had said before to a large degree.
Also, there is less of a tendency to go back and read my previous
notes.  I end up just "collecting" the ideas rather than trying to
think about them to move my thoughts forward.
</p>

<p>
We can try to fix this issue by leaving the original note in place,
perhaps in a daily note, and then postpone the process of splitting
the note into "atomic" notes during a later review process.  The fear
is that we may not be able to find these atomic notes later, but
perhaps we can hedge against this by using tags related to the
categories that it may be relevant to.  Also, we might link the atomic
note to the daily note or the original source note.
</p></li>

<li><p>
autonomous
</p>

<p>
The notes should be understandable on their own.  It should not
require additional context for a reader to understand its meaning.
It might refer to external information, but it should not depend on
this external information.
</p>

<p>
Why is this?  While a note you write may make sense to you when you
write it, and even a few days later, after a year or so, this may
not be easy to understand.
</p></li>

<li>connectivity
<ul>
<li>uplinks</li>
<li>backlinks</li>
<li></li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<p>
One of the main pr
</p>




<p>
With this, we need to emphasize the importance of using good tags to
find your information later.  You might thing of tags as being the
categories that you would have used to file your note away in a
conventional hierarchical organization system.

As mentioned previously, the environment that we find ourselves in is
changing rapidly.  A lot of the tools that we have access to now did not
exist just a few years ago.  
Consequently, one of the main things that we need to consider is
future proofing our work.
</p>

<p>
In my undergraduate, my first laboratory report was written on a
typewriter.  In fact, in one of my early essays for English
composition, I though I was being really clever, and I went to the
computer labs 
</p>

<p>
It was not until my second or third year that PC's and
word processing programs became prevalent.
</p>

<p>
By the time I started my PhD, the standard for word processing was
WordPerfect, and my first reports were written using this.  In
addition, the first software that I made graphs and charts in was
a program called FreeLance.
</p>

<p>
However, the companies that released these software packages have long
since folded.  As a consequence of this, you cannot directly
open the files
