<p>
I hope everyone enjoyed the sessions from the library and took away
something useful.  Those lectures / workshops were mainly about how to
acquire information, which is a very important skill.
</p>

<p>
Now accessing and collecting information is not very difficult, as you
have learned from the last two lectures from Alasdair.  Even knowing
how to do complicated calculations is not as valued, as there is a lot
of sophisticated software that is freely available to use.
</p>

<p>
In the past, just having information and knowledge were some of the
big reasons that an engineer was valued.  Data sources were difficult
to access.  These were at a premium.  In fact, this is still the case
for many people doing their PhD in fields like history or literature.
Often, certain topics can only be pursued in specific universities,
such as Cambridge, because the original sources are available to be
studied and examined.
</p>

<p>
Methods to make calculations were fairly difficult to implement and
</p>

<p>
Even the resources to do computations were scarce in the relatively
recent past.
</p>

<p>
Your value as an engineer, however, is no longer about acquiring and
repeating this information or the calculations.  It is more about
interpreting and translating it into a form that is relevant to the
problem at hand.  Part of this ascertaining the value of the
information, which can crudely be translated into whether it is true
or not.
</p>

<p>
What we are going to talk about today is trying to critically evaluate
the information.

One of the main sources of information that you will be referring to
are articles in scientific or technical journals.
</p>

<p>
You have probably heard phrases like "listen to the science" or this
information was from a "refereed journal article" stated in the news
or YouTube channels or in general conversation.  This reflects an
opinion that things published in peer reviewed journals are
"indisputable truth".
</p>

<p>
Another alternative view is that scientists are very conservative, and
they do not want any disturbance of their orthodoxy.  The scientists
are a bunch of gatekeepers 
</p>

<p>
What is your impression of the scientific literature?

<p>
Typically, it is that what appears in a scientific peer reviewed journal

<li>submission of a manuscript to a journal</li>
<li>The editor scans the manuscript and decides whether it is
appropriate for the journal, in terms of its area of research and
its perceived quality.  If the editor thinks that this is the case,
then it will be sent to be reviewed by experts in the field.</li>

<li>Authors transfer the copyright of the article to the journal.</li>

<p>
When I started graduate school, there were two big exciting
discoveries that came out.  This was somewhat exciting, as we were
able to see the manuscripts of these works through the internet.  We
did not have to wait for the papers to be published in printed volumes
that were then delivered to the library.
</p>

<p>
The first was high temperature superconductors, which were made of
ceramic materials.  Actually, they were not high temperature in terms
of current standards, as they were only superconducting well below the
boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen, but for the time they were
much higher than for other known superconducting materials.
</p>

<p>
The other big discovery was cold fusion.  Pons and Fleischmann were
two very big scientists in the area of electrochemistry.
</p>

<p>
electrochemistry in heavy water using platinum electrodes.  They reported that
an excess of heat was generated from the
</p>



<p>
This is not to say that
</p>


<p>

</p>


<p>
Another big controversy is water memory.  This is a paper that appeared in
the journal Nature.  10.1038/333816a0
This is a journal that many scientist dream of publishing in.
</p>


<p>
So why am I talking about this?  It is mainly to give you a different
perspective about why scientists publish.  The idea of science in the
general public is that scientists are fairly conservative.
</p>

<p>
Discoveries or breakthroughs, however, necessarily challenge
conventional wisdom.  The typical idea is that scientists do not like
to challenge convention.  However, within scientific publishing,
breaking convention is actually what you want to do.  So you need to
understand the motivation of the authors of publications to get a
perspective on the credibility of the information.

Given that the majority of the funds that go into scientific research
is from public money, such as through funding of universities through
research grants, funding of PhD students, co-funding of industrial
knowledge exchange projects, etc., as well as funding of national
government laboratories, such as the National Physical Laboratories
in the UK.

<p>
So given that commercial publishers make great profits from publishing
scientific work, and that most of the work involved in the pursuit of
the research, the writing of the manuscript, and the evaluation and
editing of the manuscripts are done essentially for free (and even
often paying for the privilege to publish their work) and that the
institutions they work for need to pay to access the content, you
would be justified in wondering what motivates a research to publish
their work.
</p>

<p>
Citations become extremely important in the evaluation of the work of
researchers.  In some countries, most notably in Australia, the
evaluation of academic research is based very heavily on
bibliometrics, which are things like the number publications that a
research has published, the number of citations each publication has
received, the h-index of the researcher, the ranking of the journal
(based on its impact factor), etc.
</p>

<p>
The award of research funding is tied closely to the bibliometric
ranking of the

The initial scan of your materials should not necessarily be a
critical review.  In the first instance you should be trying to gain a
feel of what kind of resources that you have, and think of themes that
you can pull together from them.
</p>

<p>
It is good to try to set aside time to devote to reading the materials
that you have collected.
</p>

<p>
When you extract facts from a paper, you should reflect on how those
facts could have been obtained?  For example, let's say that
</p>

<ul>
<li>particle size distribution from a light scattering measurement</li>
<li>temperature of a probe</li>
<li>temperature of the Earth 2000 years ago?</li>

Although you may have an argument in mind when you were searching for and
collecting your references, you still should be open to what you

you.

<li>Hopefully, from what I have just discussed about the scientific

To a large extent this is due to genuine interest in the topic, while
other pressures include how the performance of researchers is evaluated
and how funding is distributed.</li>

<li>Before we dive into how to be critical of information, or more
specifically, the content of the sources that you have gathered, we
need to put the question into context so we have a concrete idea of
what we are actually trying to achieve.</li>

<li><p>
When you are told that you should be critical of a piece of
information, what does that really mean for you to do?  What are you
trying to do when you are being critical of a piece of work?  One
answer is that you are trying to be negative about the work, trying
to find shortcomings or faults.  Another answer is that you are
trying to determine if the work or the information it contains is
"true" or not (similarly if it is correct or not).

about what is the "truth".  As engineers, and even at some level as
human beings, we are not concerned about the "truth".  This
perspective immediately brings up a whole lot of underlying
assumptions about the world, in particular that all things can be
divided into two categories: true and false.  You have to realize
that this is a starting assumption, and the world may not actually
be that way.</li>

<p>
So before we can be critical
</p>

<p>
A big way that we understand things is through models or stories that
we tell ourselves.  These are not necessarily grounded in what we
might strictly call truth, but they are crucial in the way choose to do things.
</p>

<p>
Overimitation
</p>

<p>
A big danger is
</p>

<p>
Remember
Niklas Luhmann and social systems theory.  
</p>


<p>
We need to have a basic idea about how we understand and interact with
the world in order to have a perspective on how to think critically.
</p>


<ul>
<li>From an engineering perspective we are not necessarily interested in
what is true and what is not we are more interested in the pragmatic
question of how to get something to work.</li>

<li>As an example think of all the things that you've learned in the
course so far in all the different models that you've taken.  In
fact nothing that you've learned is actually what is currently
accepted as true from modern science.</li>

<li>The real world contains much more information than we are able to
process or can be conscious of.  These models let us ignore a large
amount of information and just focus on</li>

<li>That is part of the reason psychologically why it's very difficult
for people to change their belief systems even in the face of
overwhelming evidence to the contrary that what they believe doesn't
lead to something that is able to get them to to interact positively
with the world around them.  The models that we have in our head
about how the world operates actually extremely powerful tools for
us to understand how to do things and go about our daily lives it
allows us to understand and what we can ignore and what we can't
ignore and need to pay attention to.</li>

<li>Different disciplines have different stories that understand the
world in terms of.  So what is thought of as understanding or clear
explanation in one field may not be seen as useful in another field.</li>
<li>Think how this comes into play if you are trying to work with people
from another discipline.  As an example, I have tried to collaborate
with people in biology, looking at models for proteins and their
interactions with each other.</li>

<li>another example is working with chemists.  There, molecules play a
big role in how they address problems&#x2026; and depending on the
specialization, they may think of bonds, functional groups, size,
etc.</li>

</ul>


<ul>
<li>When you dive too deeply into a particular field of study you
sometimes convince yourself that the models and perspectives that
are used really reflect the absolute truth of how the world
operates.  The sort of common saying is that if you are a carpenter
then every problem looks like a nail.</li>

<li>This comes into play when we examine the difference between
industrial research and academic research.  Now again I'm
simplifying the argument into by dividing research into two distinct
categories but this is just a starting point for us to try to
understand the problem more concretely.</li>

</ul>



<ul>
<li>black box: Everything that we deal with is a black box at some
level.  When we are using our mobile phones, we do not really have
any idea about how</li>

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
One common myth about the origin of money is that is came about as a
way to solve some of the problems with bartering, a system of exchange
where goods and services are traded directly for each other.
</p>

<p>
The original form of money is commodity money, which is money that
is a commodity, such as a precious metal or livestock.

So now we have covered the potential issues with scientific
publishing, and a bit about the perspective that we take as engineers
to a particular issues.  We are always thinking about the useful ideas
that we can take from a paper.
</p>

<p>
Every time you use a source, you should be asking yourself these
questions.  
</p>

<p>
When should you be asking yourself these questions?  It probably not a
good time to do it if you get a thought while you are reading or
viewing a video.  It is better just to write a note and reference it.
</p>

<p>
It is better to ask these questions when you are going back to review
your literature notes to create permanent notes from them.  Perhaps,
you could use two different "Kastens" for your literature notes: one
which is reviewed, and the other which is not.
</p>

<p>
A lot of disagreements between people are not because any facts are
incorrect or the logic that is used is wrong.

You will need to take your general area and start to narrow the scope
of your report.  
</p>

<p>
You want to avoid making your report just a laundry list of facts., as
well.  There should be some kind of theme, insight, or question that
you are trying to provide to the reader.
